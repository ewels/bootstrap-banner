Add a global website banner using a Bootstrap alert box.

== Description ==

A WordPress Customise Widget to add a global website banner, styled using a [Bootstrap alert box](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.4/components/alerts/).

The plugin assumes that you're already using Bootstrap, so you need to load the Bootstrap javascript and CSS separately.

* [Download Twitter Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/)
* [Bootstrap CDN](http://www.bootstrapcdn.com/) _(directly link CSS and javascript files)_
* [Bootstrap Alerts in action](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.4/components/alerts/)
